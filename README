This is the syntax highlighting script for Macromedia Directors Lingo scripting language.

I updated the file to the current version (MX2004). There might be some things missing. Feel free to add a new version here or contact me, if you want/did enhancements. 

This is an enhanced version of the lingo syntax file by Robert Robbins. I uploaded it as new script, because I stripped off the color definitions and entered new types.

I now also created an color scheme, so you get the original Director syntax colors (vimscript #1012). This way you can convert them to HTML and put them on your website. Read the description at the color scheme for details.
